# Forest Fire Spread Rate Calculation

This Python function, `calculate_fire_spread_rate`, is designed to estimate the rate of spread of a forest fire under given environmental conditions. The function takes into account several key factors that influence fire behavior in forested areas.

## Parameters

The function accepts the following parameters:

- **wind_speed_at_10m (float)**: The wind speed measured at a height of 10 meters, expressed in kilometers per hour (km/hr).
- **moisture_content (float)**: The moisture content of the environment, given as a percentage. This should be in the range of 35% to 65%.
- **slope_angle (float)**: The angle of the ground slope, expressed in degrees. This parameter accounts for the impact of terrain on fire spread.
- **fuel_load (float, optional)**: The load of combustible material, specifically referring to materials with a diameter less than 6 mm, measured in tonnes per hectare. The default value is 2 tonnes/hectare, which is a typical value for forested areas.

## Constants

The function uses several constants in its calculations:

- **a (1.674)**: A constant used for converting wind speed at 10m to wind speed at 1.5m height.
- **b (0.1798)**: Another constant used for the wind speed conversion.
- **c (0.22)**: A scaling factor for the fuel load in the rate of spread calculation.
- **d (0.158)**: A constant that modulates the influence of wind speed at 1.5m on the rate of spread.
- **e (-0.227)**: A constant that modulates the influence of moisture content on the rate of spread.
- **f (0.0662)**: A constant that modulates the influence of ground slope on the rate of spread.

## Function Mechanics

1. **Wind Speed Conversion**: The function first converts the wind speed measured at 10 meters to an estimated wind speed at 1.5 meters using the formula:<br> `wind_speed_at_1_5m = a + b * wind_speed_at_10m`.

2. **Rate of Spread on Flat Ground**: It then calculates the rate of spread on flat ground using the formula:<br> `rate_flat_ground = c * fuel_load * (wind_speed_at_1_5m ** d) * (moisture_content ** e)`.

3. **Slope Adjustment**: Finally, the function adjusts this rate based on the slope of the ground:<br> `rate_on_slope = rate_flat_ground * (slope_angle ** f)`.

## Usage

This function is useful for forest fire management and prediction purposes. By inputting various environmental conditions, one can estimate the rate at which a forest fire might spread, aiding in effective planning and response strategies.
